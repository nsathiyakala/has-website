            Volunteer information
        </div>
        <div class="para1 pad">
            We are always seeking general volunteers interested in working with animals, volunteer veterinarians, vet nurses, or vet students to work with our vets and animal care staff to sterilize and provide treatment for animals, mainly street dogs.
        </div>
        <div class="para2 pad">
            Many street dogs, mostly abandoned, suffer from starvation, infected open wounds, mange, and other diseases. The organizational goals are to humanely create a healthy, stable dog population in Coimbatore and to eliminate rabies, which kills thousands of people in India every year. We are accomplishing this through a widespread street dog sterilization program, medical treatment for sick and injured dogs, vaccinations, and humane education. The organization’s impact goes far beyond the animals it treats.
        </div>
        <div class="para3 pad">
            As a volunteer at HAS, you will have opportunities to learn different approaches to veterinary medicine and help treat illnesses and injuries that are uncommon in developed countries. You will also be able to ride on HAS’s animal ambulance with staff who catch and release street dogs and respond to emergency rescue calls. Approximately 12-20 surgeries are done per week (including spay and neuter), giving good surgical exposure for you. Additionally, we hope you will share your knowledge and experience so as to help make sustained improvements to our programs.

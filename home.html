            Welcome to the Humane Animal Society!

        </div>
        <div class="para1 pad">
            Humane Animal Society (HAS) was established in April 2006 as a non-profit trust under the Indian Trust Act to address the welfare of stray animals in the city of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. This we do through animal birth control and anti-rabies drives, and by rescuing animals that are in urgent need of treatment. The rescued animals are treated and rehabilitated at our ABC and Rescue Centre before being released back to their community. The HAS Sanctuary becomes the new home of the ones for whom release wouldn't be safe.

        <div class="para2 pad">
            HAS is also engaged in creating awareness, and advocates for the equal rights of all sentient beings.

        </div>
        <div class="para3 pad">
            HAS does receive a small amount of public funding, but is reliant on the contribution of generous individuals. By volunteering and donating, and by adopting, fostering or sponsoring individual animals, you not only have a direct and measurable impact on the well-being of stray animals in Coimbatore, but also on the almost 200 cats and dogs, plus a cow and a horse, that live at the Sanctuary or are being treated at the ABC and Rescue Centre.

            The HAS Sanctuary offers a permanent home to animals who have been either victims of road traffic accidents or handicapped due to lack of vision or hearing in old age. These animals, who have overcome great hardship, pain and trauma, need a life-time of care and support to lead happy and fulfilled lives. If you are unable to adopt one of our Sanctuary residents because you already have pets at home or cannot commit to the lifelong care of an animal, sponsoring one of our residents is a wonderful alternative way of helping an animal. By choosing to become a virtual pet parent instead, you get all the benefits of helping care for a needy soul.

            A life saving monthly gift, INR 4,000 (USD 50) for a dog and INR 2,000 (USD 25) for a cat, pays for all the care needs of your new virtual best friend, and gives them the assurance that they will remain safe and loved for as long as they need us. Partial sponsorships are also possible. To choose your lucky pet, browse through our selection of adorable sponsorship candidates or visit them at the ABC and Rescue Centre or at the Sanctuary. When you become a sponsor, you may actually visit your virtual pet whenever you like, and we will give you regular updates on how they are doing. If interested, we will also involve you in any decisions that may need to be made regarding their health and welfare.
